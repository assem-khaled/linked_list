- print the linked list
- get number of nodes
- insert first node
- insert last node
- insert in id order node
- insert node using index
- delete first node
- delete last node
- delete node from index
- delete node from id
- delete all nodes
- sort all nodes with id
- get node data from node index (head node starts with 0)
- get node data from node ID   

All function returns -1 in case of wrong or nonexistent data
